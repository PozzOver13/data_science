## Introduction

Let's the March Madness begins! 
Even though, predicting the probability of the NCAA tournament it is clearly a complex topic, the first move in order to do so it is to understand the historical data that we had.

We will start observing just from 2014 to 2017.

```{r}

#### SET UP #### 
require(tidyverse)

#### DATA IMPORT ####
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/data_science/ncaa_2018")
results = read_csv("~/datainput/DataFiles/RegularSeasonCompactResults.csv")
seeds = read_csv("/datainput/DataFiles/NCAATourneySeeds.csv")
teams = read_csv("/datainput/DataFiles/Teams.csv")
coaches = read_csv("/datainput/DataFiles/TeamCoaches.csv")

time_horizon = 2014:2017

# selecting just the season in which we are interested in
results_ok = results %>%
  filter(Season %in% time_horizon)

seeds_ok = seeds %>%
  filter(Season %in% time_horizon)

```

In order to start our EDA, we need to set our hypothesis:

1. Home / Away probably doesn't matter there we need to focus on seeds
2. We need to aggregate results in order to understand the better defensive teams ("offense sells tickets, defense wins championships")
3. We need to incluede the quality of the coaches
